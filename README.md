# Introduction : 
These programs are designed to help you practice essential programming skills in C++. They cover a range of basic operations, including arithmetic, comparison, character checking, and conditional statements.  
## Program 1: basic calculator:
## Logic explaination:  
this program implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The steps are:  

1.User Input: The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).    
2.Perform Operation: The program performs the selected arithmetic operation.    
3.Display Result: The result of the operation is displayed to the user.   
## Program 2: Find the largest three numbers:  
## logic explaination:
This program finds the largest of three numbers entered by the user. The logic includes:  

1.User Input: The user inputs three numbers.  
2.Comparison: The program compares the three numbers to determine the largest one.  
3.Output Result: The largest number is displayed. 
## Program 3: Vowel check
## Logic explaination:
This program determines the day of the week based on a number from 1 to 7. The steps are:

1.User Input: The user inputs a number between 1 and 7.
2.Determine Day: The program maps the number to a corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.).
3.Output Result: The corresponding day is displayed.

## Program 4: Determine weekday:
## Logic explaination:  
This program determines the day of the week based on a number from 1 to 7. The steps are:

1.User Input: The user inputs a number between 1 and 7.
2.Determine Day: The program maps the number to a corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.).
3.Output Result: The corresponding day is displayed.

## Program 5: Even or odd check
## Logic explaination:
This program checks whether a given number is even or odd. The steps are:

1.User Input: The user inputs a number.
2.Check Even or Odd: The program checks if the number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd).
3.Output Result: The result (even or odd) is displayed.
